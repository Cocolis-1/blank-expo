# Blank Expo

This is a blank project, a minimal Expo app that you can use for testing and reproducing issues without all the tools and libraries used in a real-world scenario.

Keep the main branch as is and create a new branch for every test case you want to reproduce. This will make it easier for you to isolate issues and share them with others.
